# Pneumonia-Detection-with-CNNs:-Training-and-Evaluating-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-on-X-ray-Images-for-Accurate-Diagnosis
This project focuses on training machine learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to detect pneumonia using x-ray images. The dataset contains 4627 training images and 1168 test images, with the training images labeled into three classes: no disease, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia.

The approach involves several steps:

Data Pre-processing: Images were resized and converted to grayscale, with the optimal size found to be 256 x 256 pixels.
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and validation sets, with a 90-10 ratio.
Model Training: Various CNN architectures were explored through 29 submissions, with the best model consisting of 6 convolutional layers with 32, 32, 64, 64, 64, and 64 filters.
Model Evaluation: The best model achieved 85.18% training accuracy, 82.265% validation accuracy, and 83.732% accuracy on the in-class Kaggle leaderboard.
In this project we successfully employed CNN models for classifying x-ray images and detecting pneumonia cases.
